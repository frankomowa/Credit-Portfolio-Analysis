# Credit Portfolio Analysis

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to examine the credit risk and loan performance of a digital lending platform over the years, providing insights into what constitutes good and bad loans, identifying loan KPIs and key risk indicators, and creating a multi-dashboard Power BI report for loan monitoring and credit strategy.

## Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the company's loan data, containing detailed information about each loan application made by the organisation.

## Tools

- Google Sheets - For initial data cleaning
- MSSQL - For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and KPI querying
- Power BI - For interactive dashboard creation

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

An initial data cleaning was conducted before the exploratory data analysis. The following steps were taken to clean the dataset:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values and removing duplicates
3. Handling formatting
4. Validating data

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the dataset to identify KPIs, loan status, borrowers' profiles, regional analysis and sales trends.
